gcc -Wall 1.c
this gives the warnings 
 
 
 gcc -E 1.c > 1.i(if we want to change the name 1.i as say 2.i then we should use -o option) 
 this genereates the 1.i the code after preprocessing phase
 then use cat 1.i is used to open the file 
 
 gcc -S 1.c > 1.s
 this generates the 1.s the code shows the assembly code 
 i.e after the compilation phase
 
 gcc -c 1.c 
 this generates 1.o file ie the phase after assembly phase
 
 gcc -Wall 1.c -o 1 -lm // lm is used to link to the math library. math.h is stored in libm.so so lm is used for that
